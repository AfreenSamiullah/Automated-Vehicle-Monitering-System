# Automated-Vehicle-Monitering-System
This project introduces an end-to-end Smart Vehicle Entry and Monitoring System, integrating hardware sensors, microcontrollers, and cloud services. Built around the ESP32-CAM module, it automates and digitizes vehicle entry information, including license plate detection, image capture, data extraction, and organized storage.
